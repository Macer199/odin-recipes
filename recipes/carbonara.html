<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>1 pound of spaghetti</li>
        <li class="main">1/2 pound of guanciale*</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup of pecorino cheese</li>
    </ul>
    
<div>*If you do not have guanciale, consider the following alternatives:
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Use pancetta.</li>
        <li>Use bacon.</li>
        <li id="crazy">No other alternatives! Get that meat!</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Cut the guanciale into 1/2 inch cubes and place in a pan on medium heat.</li>
        <li>while the guanciale cooks, grate the pecorino cheese onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Boil water in a pot, and place a generous amount of salt in it. The salt 
            gives the pasta flavor. Save some of the water.</li>
        <li>Place the spaghetti in the boiling water, and let it cook for 11 
            minutes.</li>
        <li>While the spaghetti cooks, crack the eggs and put 3 egg yolks and 1 whole 
            egg in a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs with some pecorino cheese and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Once cooked and the fat rendered, put the guanciale into a bowl.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is cooked, place it onto the pan with the guanciale fat and 
            mix and stop the heat. That way, the egg slurry we made will not cook the 
            eggs. Stop the heat for the pot as well.
        </li>
        <li>Put the egg slurry and some guanciale on the pan and mix it with the 
            spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Get a small cup of hot water from the pot, put in the pan, and mix well. The 
            starch from the water will bind the sauce with the pasta.
        </li>
        <li>Serve on a plate and garnish with some of the guanciale and pecorino you 
            may have left over.
        </li>
        <li class="main">Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
