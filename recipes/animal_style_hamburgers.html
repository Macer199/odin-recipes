<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        If you are a Californian, it is very likely that you have heard of In-N-Out, an 
        iconic hamburger staple with a simple, yet never-changing menu of burgers, 
        fries, and shakes. Priding itself on making things the old-fashioned way, 
        quality is the most important ingredient. A close second would be their animal 
        style sauce, which can elevate your experience and provide new flavor to the 
        burgers and fries they serve. Now you can make it home, and experience the same 
        deliciousness you would in In-N-Out. Here, we will make two single patty, 
        animal style hamburgers.
