<h2>Description</h1>
    <p>
        A delicious Mexican staple, the burrito is a food that is so popular within 
        the American food culture that there has been debate as to whether it is 
        Mexican or actually American. The fact of the matter is, it's Mexican. But 
        that should not stop you from enjoying the flavors that it offers. Wrapped 
        within a tortilla, the combination of meat, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole 
        will provide a wonderful experience.

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Season your carne asada with salt and pepper, and place in a pan with a 
            light drizzle of olive oil. The steak should be at least medium rare. Flip 
            when needed.
        </li>
        <li>Cut your avocado, cilantro and lime, and dice your tomato and onion.</li>
        <li>Scoop the avocado into a bowl with your diced tomato and onion, squeeze 
            some lime, put a dash of salt and pepper, and squish and mix really well 
            after putting in the cilantro. Add more lime, salt, pepper, and cilantro 
            to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Grate 4 ounces of cheddar cheese on a plate.</li>
        <li>When your carne asada is done cooking, place on a plate and let it rest 
            for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>While your carne asada is resting, lay out a flour tortilla, spread the 
            sour cream and place some grated cheese on it.
        </li>
        <li>Once the carne asada rested, cut into 1-inch strips, and put it on the 
            tortilla, as well as your guacamole.
        </li>
        <li>Fold the tortilla into a burrito and cook it for a few minutes more on a 
            pan to warm it up.
        </li>
        <li>Slice it in half and serve on a plate.</li>
        <li class="main">Enjoy!</li>
